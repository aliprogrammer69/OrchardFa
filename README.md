**OrchardFa, a happy and delicious version of Orchard CMS!**
=

Here is Orchard in Farsi!
**OrchardFa** is a Persian translated version of [Microsoft's open source CMS called **Orchard**][1].

Notice that this repository only contains ready to use version of **OrchardFa**. There is no difference between **OrchardFa** and official **Orchard** source code at this point. This is just manipulated version of stylesheets, themes and translated PO files.
