Here is Orchard in Farsi!
**OrchardFa** is a Persian translated version of [Microsoft's open source CMS called **Orchard**][1].

Notice that this repository only contains ready to use version of **OrchardFa**. There is no difference between **OrchardFa** and official **Orchard** source code at this point. This is just manipulated version of stylesheets, themes and translated PO files.

**Issues:**
This project is not ready for commercial use, and there are known issues. As you probably saw, Dashboard menu's icons should be aligned at right. Also most of strings are not translated. so don't be shy and feel free to Fork **OrchardFa** and improve it!
